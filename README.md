PROJECT

Exercise of the DS Master we are attending. This script (word-count-alice.sh) reads a txt file and exports a new one with the words ranked by their frequency down to a minimum value, which can be set up. 

CONTACT AND CONTRIBUTION

This is a class project in which Francisco Cotera Gonz√°lez also participated and It is not open to contributions right now though I am open to it, feel free to share any comment, question or suggestion through javiercuartasmicieces@hotmail.com.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

The script was developed following our teachers guidance (Data Science Master of the UC), as well as some online resources you can check in the script itself.
